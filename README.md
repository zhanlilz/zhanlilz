## My own notes/tips on using the Academic Template

* content/publications: Add a pdf under a publication folder (e.g., li-2018)
  named after this publication folder name (i.e., li-2018.pdf under
  content/publication/li-2018). The pdf button on the publication page will give
  users the pdf.

* static/sub-folder-name: Files under this folder can be referred in the .md
  files as sub-folder-name/a-file

* menus.yaml: Change the ``weight`` property of each menu item to change its
  display location on top of the home page. The larger the weight, the more
  right / further back the item will be displayed.

* content/home/tags.md: This is the word cloud displayed under "Popular Topics"
  on the published page. It uses tags in all the .md files. Currently, most tags
  are from the index.md files in the publication folders. 

* Create a new post. For more details, https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/blog-posts/
  ```
  $ hugo new --kind post post/my-article-name
  ```

* Create a new publication. For more details, https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/publications/
  * Import from a .bib file
    ```
    $ academic import --bibtex <path_to_your/publications.bib>
    ```
  * Mannually create one
    ```
    $ hugo new --kind publication publication/<my-publication>
    ```
