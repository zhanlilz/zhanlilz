Zhan Li's research is currently focused on observing and understanding (1)
changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and (2) their impacts on
the energy, water, and carbon fluxes in land-water complexes. He specializes in
remote sensing of land at a range of spatial scales (plot to global, fine to
medium resolution), by multiple sensors (multispectral, lidar, radar) on
different platforms (ground, airborne and satellite). He has worked on several
projects on remote sensing applications funded by different agencies, such as
NASA's MODIS Science Team and USGS's Landsat Science Team via working with [Dr.
Crystal Schaaf](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass), and Canadian Space Agency via
working with [Dr. Mike
Wulder](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Wulder) and [Dr. Joanne
White](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanne-White). Zhan Li received his
PhD from Boston University via working with [Dr. Alan
Strahler](http://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/alan-h-strahler/).
