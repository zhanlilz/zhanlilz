    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Zhan Li's research is currently focused on observing and understanding (1)
changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and (2) their impacts on
the energy, water, and carbon fluxes in land-water complexes. He specializes in
remote sensing of land at a range of spatial scales (plot to global, fine to
medium resolution), by multiple sensors (multispectral, lidar, radar) on
different platforms (ground, airborne and satellite). He has worked on several
projects on remote sensing applications funded by different agencies, such as
NASA's MODIS Science Team and USGS's Landsat Science Team via working with [Dr.
Crystal Schaaf](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass), and Canadian Space Agency via
working with [Dr. Mike
Wulder](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Wulder) and [Dr. Joanne
White](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanne-White). Zhan Li received his
PhD from Boston University via working with [Dr. Alan
Strahler](http://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/alan-h-strahler/).
