abstract: Land surface albedo is an essential variable for surface energy and climate
  modeling as it describes the proportion of incident solar radiant flux that is reflected
  from the Earth’s surface. To capture the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity
  of the land surface, satellite remote sensing must be used to monitor albedo accurately
  at a global scale. However, large data gaps caused by cloud or ephemeral snow have
  slowed the adoption of satellite albedo products by the climate modeling community.
  To address the needs of this community, we used a number of temporal and spatial
  gap-filling strategies to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of the global
  land surface MODIS BRDF, albedo and NBAR products. A rigorous evaluation of the
  gap-filled values shows good agreement with original high quality data (RMSE = 0.027
  for the NIR band albedo, 0.020 for the red band albedo). This global snow-free and
  cloud-free MODIS BRDF and albedo dataset (established from 2001 to 2015) offers
  unique opportunities to monitor and assess the impact of the changes on the Earth’s
  land surface.
