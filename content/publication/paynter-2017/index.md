abstract: In this study, we introduce metaproperty analysis of terrestrial laser scanner
  (TLS) data, and demonstrate its application through several ecological classification
  problems. Metaproperty analysis considers pulse level and spatial metrics derived
  from the hundreds of thousands to millions of lidar pulses present in a single scan
  from a typical contemporary instrument. In such large aggregations, properties of
  the populations of lidar data reflect attributes of the underlying ecological conditions
  of the ecosystems. In this study, we provide the Metaproperty Classification Model
  to employ TLS metaproperty analysis for classification problems in ecology. We applied
  this to a proof‐of‐concept study, which classified 88 scans from rooms and forests
  with 100% accuracy, to serve as a template. We then applied the Metaproperty Classification
  Model in earnest, to separate scans from temperate and tropical forests with 97.09%
  accuracy (N = 224), and to classify scans from inland and coastal tropical rainforests
  with 84.07% accuracy (N = 270). The results demonstrate the potential for metaproperty
  analysis to identify subtle and important ecosystem conditions, including diseases
  and anthropogenic disturbances. Metaproperty analysis serves as an augmentation
  to contemporary object reconstruction applications of TLS in ecology, and can characterize
  regional heterogeneity.
