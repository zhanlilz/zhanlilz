abstract: Satellite-based retrievals of land surface albedo at 20-m resolution are
  generated by coupling the surface reflectances from the recently launched Sentinel-2A
  satellite with surface anisotropy information (as described by Bidirectional Reflectance
  Distribution Function, BRDF) from either the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
  (MODIS) or the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The intrinsic
  black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) values of the surface are derived
  at the six shortwave spectral bands of Sentinel-2A's Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI).
  A specific set of narrow-to-broadband conversion coefficients is derived from radiative
  transfer simulations and presented for the generation of broadband albedos. Initial
  evaluation uses well-calibrated ground-based albedo measurements by pyranometers
  mounted on the towers at seven sites of the Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD).
  Over those sites where pyranometer measurement footprints are not spatially representative
  of the landscape covered by the satellite pixels (i.e., spatially nonrepresentative)
  at the grid scales (500 m to 1 km) of the MODIS and VIIRS products, the finer-resolution
  Sentinel-2A albedos manifested a pronounced decrease in root mean squared error
  (RMSE) and mean bias in the evaluation against the ground-based data as compared
  to the coarser resolution albedo products of MODIS and VIIRS. This decrease occurs
  because the 20-m Sentinel-2A albedo values are better able to resolve the spatial
  details of surface albedo within the ground-based instrument footprints than the
  coarser resolution sensors. This preliminary evaluation also demonstrates the consistency
  of the Sentinel-2A albedo results whether using the MODIS BRDF or the VIIRS BRDF
  products for the surface anisotropy information. The RMSEs and mean biases of the
  Sentinel-2A albedos over all the seven validation sites are both within the accuracy
  requirement of ±0.05 absolute albedo units for satellite derived albedo products.
  This study, to generate Sentinel-2A MSI albedo with either MODIS or VIIRS BRDFs,
  extends previous efforts of Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI albedo and enhances the continuity
  of finer-resolution albedo data. Such long-term and higher resolution records of
  surface albedo improve the investigations into the changes and drivers of local/regional
  surface energy balance over heterogeneous regions and increasingly fragmented landscapes
  across the globe due to natural and human-induced land cover changes.
