abstract: Lidar waveform features from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience
  Laser Altimeter System (ICESat/GLAS) and spectral features from Landsat Thematic
  Mapper (TM)/Enhanced TM Plus (ETM+) were used to discriminate land cover categories
  for GLAS footprints in Henan Province, China. Fifteen waveform metrics were derived
  from GLAS data while band ratios and surface spectral reflectance were taken from
  Landsat TM/ETM+. Random forest (RF) was used in feature selection and classification
  of footprints along with support vector machines (SVMs). The categories of classification
  included croplands, forests, shrublands, water bodies, and impervious surfaces.
  Compared with the use of waveform or spectral features alone in land cover classification,
  the joint use of waveform and spectral data as inputs improved the classification
  accuracy of footprints. An overall accuracy (OA) of 91% was achieved by either RF
  or SVM when features from both GLAS and Landsat sources were used increasing upon
  an accuracy of 85% if only one source was used. The high accuracy land cover data
  obtained by the joint use of the two data sources could be used as additional references
  in large scale land cover mapping when ground truth is hard to obtain. It is believed
  that the increase in accuracy is largely a result from the inclusion of the additional
  information of vertical structure offered by waveform lidar.
