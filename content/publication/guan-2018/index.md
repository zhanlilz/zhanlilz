abstract: 'This study uses multiple satellite datasets to map paddy rice areas and
  yields for the Thai Binh Province, Viet Nam, over the summer growing season of 2015.
  The major datasets used are: first, surface reflectance and vegetation indices (VI)
  by fusing the optical observations from the Landsat sensors and the MODerate Resolution
  Imaging Spectroradiometer; and second, the L-band radar data from the PALSAR-2 sensor
  onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2. We find that although the fused
  VI time series are not necessarily beneficial for paddy rice mapping, the fusion
  datasets reduce observational gaps and allow us to better identify peak VI values
  and derive their empirical relationships with crop-cutting yield data (R 2 = 0.4
  for all the rice types, and R 2 = 0.69 for the dominant rice type -58% of all the
  sampled fields). The L-band radar data have slightly lower performance in rice mapping
  than the optical satellite data, while it has much less contribution to yield estimation
  than the optical data. Furthermore, our study suggests the geolocation errors of
  satellite images be taken into account when selecting small sample are as for crop
  cutting. This practice will ensure the representativeness of crop-cutting sample
  areas with regard to satellite observations and thus better linkages between field
  data and satellite pixels for yield modeling. We also highlight the need of crop-cutting
  data from multiple years and/or at different regions to account for the spatial
  and temporal variations of harvest index to improve the spatially explicit rice
  yield estimates through satellite observations.'
