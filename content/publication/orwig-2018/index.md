abstract: 'Contemporary terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is being used widely in forest
  ecology applications to examine ecosystem properties at increasing spatial and temporal
  scales. Harvard Forest (HF) in Petersham, MA, USA, is a long-term ecological research
  (LTER) site, a National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) location and contains
  a 35 ha plot which is part of Smithsonian Institution&#039;s Forest Global Earth
  Observatory (ForestGEO). The combination of long-term field plots, eddy flux towers
  and the detailed past historical records has made HF very appealing for a variety
  of remote sensing studies. Terrestrial laser scanners, including three pioneering
  research instruments: the Echidna Validation Instrument, the Dual-Wavelength Echidna
  Lidar and the Compact Biomass Lidar, have already been used both independently and
  in conjunction with airborne laser scanning data and forest census data to characterize
  forest dynamics. TLS approaches include three-dimensional reconstructions of a plot
  over time, establishing the impact of ice storm damage on forest canopy structure,
  and characterizing eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) canopy health affected by
  an invasive insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Efforts such as
  those deployed at HF are demonstrating the power of TLS as a tool for monitoring
  ecological dynamics, identifying emerging forest health issues, measuring forest
  biomass and capturing ecological data relevant to other disciplines. This paper
  highlights various aspects of the ForestGEO plot that are important to current TLS
  work, the potential for exchange between forest ecology and TLS, and emphasizes
  the strength of combining TLS data with long-term ecological field data to create
  emerging opportunities for scientific study.'
