abstract: 'We describe the capabilities and performance of a terrestrial laser scanning
  instrument built for the purpose of recording and retrieving the three-dimensional
  structure of forest vegetation. The dual-wavelength Echidna® lidar characterizes
  the forest structure at an angular resolution as fine as 1 mrad while distinguishing
  between leaves and trunks by exploiting their differential reflectances at two wavelengths:
  1 and 1.5 μm. The instrument records the full waveforms of return signals from 5
  ns laser pulses at half-nanosecond time resolution; obtains ±117 deg zenith and
  360 deg azimuth coverage out to a radius of more than 70 m; provides single-target
  range resolution of 4.8 and 2.3 cm for the 1 and 1.5 μm channels, respectively (1σ);
  and separates adjacent pulse returns in the same waveform at a distance of 52.0
  and 63.8 cm apart for the 1 and 1.5 μm channels, respectively. The angular resolution
  is in part controlled by user-selectable divergence optics and is shown to be textless2
  mrad for the instrument’s standard resolution mode, while the signal-to-noise ratio
  is 10 at 70 m range for targets with leaf-like reflectance for both channels. The
  portability and target differentiation make the instrument an ideal ground-based
  lidar suited for vegetation sensing.'
