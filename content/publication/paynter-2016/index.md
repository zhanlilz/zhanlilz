abstract: A new wave of terrestrial lidar scanners, optimized for rapid scanning and
  portability, such as the Compact Biomass Lidar (CBL), enable and improve observations
  of structure across a range of important ecosystems. We performed studies with the
  CBL in temperate and tropical forests, caves, salt marshes and coastal areas subject
  to erosion. By facilitating additional scanning points, and therefore view angles,
  this new class of terrestrial lidar alters observation coverage within samples,
  potentially reducing uncertainty in estimates of ecosystem properties. The CBL has
  proved competent at reconstructing trees and mangrove roots using the same cylinder-based
  Quantitative Structure Models commonly utilized for data from more capable instruments
  (Raumonen et al. 2013). For tropical trees with morphologies that challenge standard
  reconstruction techniques, such as the buttressed roots of Ceiba trees and the multiple
  stems of strangler figs, the CBL was able to provide the versatility and the speed
  of deployment needed to fully characterize their unique features. For geomorphological
  features, the deployment flexibility of the CBL enabled sampling from optimal view-angles,
  including from a novel suspension system for sampling salt marsh creeks. Overall,
  the practical aspects of these instruments, which improve deployment logistics,
  and therefore data acquisition rate, are shown to be emerging capabilities, greatly
  increasing the potential for observation, particularly in highly temporally dynamic,
  inaccessible and geometrically complex ecosystems. In order to better analyze information
  quality across these diverse and challenging ecosystems, we also provide a novel
  and much-needed conceptual framework, the microstate model, to characterize and
  mitigate uncertainties in terrestrial lidar observations.
