abstract: Considering the trajectories of pulses from terrestrial laser scanners (TLS)
  can provide refined models of occlusion and improve the assessment of observation
  quality in forests and other ecosystems. By considering the space traversed by light
  detection and ranging (lidar) pulses, we can separate empty regions of an ecosystem
  sample from unobserved regions of an ecosystem sample. We apply this method of TLS
  observation quality assessment, and analyze Compact Biomass Lidar 2 (CBL2) TLS observations
  of a single tree and of a deciduous forest stand. We show the contribution of information
  from each TLS scan to be inconsistent and the combination of multiple scans to have
  diminishing returns for new information, without guaranteeing complete coverage
  of a sample. We quantitatively investigate the effects of imposing information quality
  requirements on TLS sampling, for example, requiring minimum numbers of observations
  in each region or requiring regions to be observed from a minimum number of independent
  scans. We show empirically that rigid, predefined TLS sampling schemes, even with
  hypothetically dense coverage, cannot guarantee successful samples in geometrically
  complex systems such as forests. Through these methods, we lay the groundwork for
  on-the-fly assessment of observation quality according to several modeling-relevant
  metrics which enhance TLS ecosystem assessment. We also establish the value of flexible
  deployment options for TLS instruments, including the ability to deploy at a variety
  of heights.
