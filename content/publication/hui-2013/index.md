abstract: 'A revised Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA) is presented, using
  the 1073 multi-band scenes of the original Land-sat-7 ETM+ LIMA image collection
  available at the United States Geological Survey (USGS: http://lima.usgs.gov/).
  Three improvements have been applied during the data processing: (1) DN saturation
  is adjusted by adopting a linear regression, which has a lower root mean square
  error than the ratio regression used by LIMA; (2) solar elevation angle is calculated
  using pixel-level latitude/longitude and the acquisition time and date of the central
  pixel of the scene, improving slightly upon the bilinear interpolation of the solar
  elevation angles of scene corners applied in LIMA; and (3) two additional image
  bands, Band 5 and Band 7, are sharpened using the panchromatic band (Band 8) and
  a Gram-Schmidt Spectral Sharpening algorithm to more easily distinguish snow, cloud
  and exposed rocks. The final planetary reflectance product is stored in 16-bit bands
  to preserve the full radiometric content of the scenes. A comparative statistical
  analysis among 12 sample regions indicates that the new mosaic has enhanced visual
  qualities, information entropy, and information content for land cover classification
  relative to LIMA.'
