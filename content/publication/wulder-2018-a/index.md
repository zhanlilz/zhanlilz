abstract: Wetlands are important globally for supplying clean water and unique habitat,
  and for storing vast amounts of carbon and nutrients. The geographic extent and
  state of wetlands vary over time and represent a dynamic land condition rather than
  a permanent land cover state. Herein, we combined a time series of land cover maps
  derived from Landsat data at 30-m resolution to inform on spatial and temporal changes
  to non-treed and treed wetland extents over Canada’s forested ecosystems (textgreater650
  million ha) from 1984 to 2016. Overall, for the period, 1984 to 2016, we found the
  extent of wetlands (non-treed and treed combined) in Canada’s forested ecosystems
  to be stable, with some regional variability, often resulting from offsetting decreases
  and increases within a given ecozone. Notwithstanding difficulties in using optical
  satellite data for mapping a land condition, by accumulating wetland evidence via
  earth observations consistently through multiple decades, our results capture the
  trends in wetland cover over a previously unmapped, national extent at a level of
  spatial detail and temporal reach suitable for further focused interpretations of
  wetlands and drivers and projections of wetland dynamics.
