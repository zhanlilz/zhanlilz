abstract: Formal planning and development of what became the first Landsat satellite
  commenced over 50 years ago in 1967. Now, having collected earth observation data
  for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat-1, the Landsat program
  is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring
  the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations,
  including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and
  provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and
  new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific
  insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which
  maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted
  in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies,
  among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational
  data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring,
  climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and
  calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing
  multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications
  have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements
  in data quality. Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional
  context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs
  of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat
  science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments
  and follow-up with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical
  context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development
  of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8
  has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding
  and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of
  Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments
  are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible
  through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual
  constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments
  create a positive feedback loopâ€”justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic
  support for Landsat.
