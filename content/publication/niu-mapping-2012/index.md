abstract: Four wetland maps for all China have been produced, based on Landsat and
  CBERS-02B remote sensing data between 1978 and 2008 (1978, 1990, 2000 and 2008).
  These maps were mainly developed by manual interpretation and validated by substantial
  field investigation in 2009. Based on these maps, we analyzed the 2008 wetland distribution
  in China and discussed wetland changes and their drivers over the past 30 years.
  (i) There were about 324097 km 2 of wetlands in 2008, for which inland marshes or
  swamps were the most common wetland type (35%), with lakes (26%) second. Most of
  the wetlands were in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Tibet, occupying
  about 55% of the national wetland area. (ii) From 1978 to 2008, China's wetland
  area continually and significantly decreased, by about 33% based on changes in the
  wetland map. This was in sharp contrast to the increase in artificial wetlands,
  which increased by about 122%. Inland marshes accounted for the main loss of total
  wetlands from 1978 to 2000. From 2000 through 2008, riverine and lacustrine wetlands
  constituted the main wetland loss. Fortunately however, the rate of wetland loss
  decreased from 5523 to 831 km 2/a. (iii) The change ratio of lost natural wetlands
  (including inland and coastal wetlands) to non-wetlands has decreased slightly over
  the past 30 years. From 1978 to 1990, nearly all natural wetlands (98%) lost were
  transformed into non-wetlands. However, the ratio declined to 86% from 1990 to 2000,
  and to 77% from 2000 to 2008. (iv) All Chinese provinces were divided into three
  groups according to patterns of wetland changes, which could relate to the driving
  forces of such changes. Tibet was completely different from other provinces, as
  it was one representative example in which there was a net wetland increase, because
  of global warming and decreased human activity since 1990. Increased economic development
  caused considerable wetland loss in most eastern provinces, and artificial wetlands
  increased.
