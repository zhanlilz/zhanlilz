abstract: Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameters,
  Albedo quantities, and Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) products derived from
  the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), on the Suomi-NPP (National
  Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite are evaluated with spatially representative
  in situ tower albedometer measurements and through comparison with the MODerate
  Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) long term record. White Sky Albedo
  (WSA), Black Sky Albedo (BSA), NBAR, and Quality Assurance (QA) results show that
  the VIIRS algorithm is performing well at the global scale and is able to provide
  global data products comparable with the heritage MODIS (with an absolute bias of
  0.0069 for shortwave broadband WSA) despite the spectral, angular, and effective
  spatial resolution differences between the two sensors. Both VIIRS and MODIS albedo
  are shown to agree well with in situ albedo measurements at a number of spatially
  representative sites. This evaluation provides confidence that the high quality,
  daily VIIRS BRDF model parameters, Albedo, and NBAR products will be able to provide
  the long term continuity required by the modeling and monitoring communities.
