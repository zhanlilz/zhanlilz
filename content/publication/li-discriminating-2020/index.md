abstract: 'Wetlands are recognized for their importance to a range of ecosystem goods
  and services; however, detailed information on wetland presence, type, extent, and
  persistence is challenging to attain over large areas and/or long time periods due
  to the spatial complexity and temporal dynamism of wetlands. In this study we explored
  the potential for within-year time series of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
  observations from the free and open Sentinel-1 data archive to improve discrimination
  of treed and non-treed wetlands and non-wetlands in a boreal forest environment.
  Through a set of 3843 classification experiments for the year 2017, we tested the
  influence of three factors on classification accuracy: (i) input features (two backscatter
  coefficients in VV and VH polarization (σVV and σVH) and four quantitative measures
  derived from the Stokes vector); (ii) the temporal form of features (i.e. using
  all within-year observations versus generalized measures such as monthly/seasonal
  means or annualized statistics); and (iii) missing observations in Sentinel-1 time
  series due to varying observation availability across space. Among the tested features,
  we found the greatest utility in σVV and σVH. Directly using all within-year observations
  yielded higher accuracy than using generalized temporal forms. Moreover, the temporal
  form of the features had a greater impact on classification accuracy than the features
  themselves. The highest overall accuracy (0.860 ± 0.002) was achieved using σVV
  and σVH from all within-year observations. The majority of class confusion occurred
  between treed wetlands and non-wetlands. We found no significant reduction in the
  overall accuracy by simulated missing observations in time series when using all
  within-year observations. With the increasing availability of free and open data
  from the Sentinel-1 archive, new opportunities are emerging to readily integrate
  within-year time series into large-area land cover mapping, particularly if analysis-ready
  SAR data products further reduce preprocessing requirements for end users.'
