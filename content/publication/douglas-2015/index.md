abstract: The dual-wavelength Echidna lidar is a portable ground-based full-waveform
  terrestrial scanning lidar for characterization of fine-scale forest structure and
  biomass content. While scanning, the instrument records the full time series of
  returns at a half-nanosecond rate from two coaligned 5-ns pulsed lasers at 1064
  and 1548 nm wavelengths. Leaves absorb more strongly at 1548 nm compared to stems,
  allowing discrimination of forest composition at milliradian scales from the ground
  to the forest canopy. This work describes the instrument design and data products
  and demonstrates the power of two wavelength lidar to clearly distinguish leaves
  from woody material with preliminary field data from the Sierra Nevada National
  Forest.
