abstract: Two wetland maps for the entire China have been produced based on Landsat
  data acquired around 1990 and 2000. Wetlands in China have been divided into 3 broad
  categories with 15 sub-categories except rice fields. In 1990, the total wetland
  area in China was 355208 km 2 whereas in 2000 it dropped to 304849 km 2 with a net
  loss of 50360 km 2. During an approximate 10-year period, inland wetland reduced
  from 318326 to 257922 km 2, coastal wetland dropped from 14335 to 12015 km 2, while
  artificial wetland increased from 22546 to 34911 km 2. The greatest natural wetland
  loss occurred in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Jilin with a total loss of over
  57000 km 2 of wetland. In western China, over 13000 km 2 of wetlands were newly
  formed in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai. About 12000 km 2 of artificial wetlands
  were also added for fish farm and reservoir constructions. The newly formed wetlands
  in western China were caused primarily by climate warming over that region whereas
  the newly created artificial wetlands were caused by economic developments. China's
  wetland loss is caused mainly by human activities. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag
