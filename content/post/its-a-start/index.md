Maybe it's time to write some blog posts on my site. This is the first one to
mark the start. I probably won't be able write much here. However, I do realize
my occassional urge to pour out some thoughts into words that nonetheless won't
fit into formal publications. Or it would take another "me" to carry out the
ideas/tasks in the thoughts of this "me" for formal publications. In this
regard, it may be good to cater to this irregular and random expressive need of
my own by writing some blog posts. I shall stick my writing here to my
research/work of the time as much as possible. But occasionally digression will
not be ruled out.
