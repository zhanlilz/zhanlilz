Land cover maps having partial or complete spatial and/or temporal overlap, different legends, and varying accuracies for similar classes, are increasingly common. To address these concerns and combine two 30-m resolution land cover products, we implemented a harmonization procedure using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The LDA model used regionalized class co-occurrences from multiple maps to generate a harmonized class label for each pixel by statistically characterizing land attributes from the class co-occurrences. We evaluated multiple harmonization approaches: using the LDA model alone and in combination with more commonly used information sources for harmonization (i.e. error matrices and semantic affinity scores). The results were compared with the benchmark maps generated using simple legend crosswalks and showed that using LDA outputs with error matrices performed better and increased harmonized map overall accuracy by 6–19% for areas of disagreement between the source maps. Our results revealed the importance of error matrices to harmonization, since excluding error matrices reduced overall accuracy by 4–20%. The LDA-based harmonization approach demonstrated in this paper is quantitative, transparent, portable, and efficient at leveraging the strengths of multiple land cover maps over large areas.","tags":["\"agriculture\"","\"bayesian\"","\"Forest\"","\"land cover\"","\"land use\"","\"landsat\"","\"LDA\""],"title":"Land cover harmonization using Latent Dirichlet Allocation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhan Li","Hao Chen","Joanne C.

In this study we explored the potential for within-year time series of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from the free and open Sentinel-1 data archive to improve discrimination of treed and non-treed wetlands and non-wetlands in a boreal forest environment. Through a set of 3843 classification experiments for the year 2017, we tested the influence of three factors on classification accuracy: (i) input features (two backscatter coefficients in VV and VH polarization (σVV and σVH) and four quantitative measures derived from the Stokes vector); (ii) the temporal form of features (i.e. using all within-year observations versus generalized measures such as monthly/seasonal means or annualized statistics); and (iii) missing observations in Sentinel-1 time series due to varying observation availability across space. Among the tested features, we found the greatest utility in σVV and σVH. Directly using all within-year observations yielded higher accuracy than using generalized temporal forms. Moreover, the temporal form of the features had a greater impact on classification accuracy than the features themselves. The highest overall accuracy (0.860 ± 0.002) was achieved using σVV and σVH from all within-year observations. The majority of class confusion occurred between treed wetlands and non-wetlands. We found no significant reduction in the overall accuracy by simulated missing observations in time series when using all within-year observations. With the increasing availability of free and open data from the Sentinel-1 archive, new opportunities are emerging to readily integrate within-year time series into large-area land cover mapping, particularly if analysis-ready SAR data products further reduce preprocessing requirements for end users.","tags":["\"Land cover\"","\"Monitoring\"","\"Synthetic aperture radar\""],"title":"Discriminating treed and non-treed wetlands in boreal ecosystems using time series Sentinel-1 data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Brehm Boucher","Steven Hancock","David A Orwig","Laura Duncanson","John Armston","Hao Tang","Keith Krause","Bruce Cook","Ian Paynter","Zhan Li","Arthur Elmes","Crystal Schaaf","B Peter Boucher","Steven Hancock","A David Orwig","Laura Duncanson","John Armston","Hao Tang","Keith Krause","Bruce Cook","Ian Paynter","Zhan Li","Arthur Elmes","Crystal Schaaf"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139897,"objectID":"7ae4f25561abf27dc32848f573e50b87","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/boucher-detecting-2020/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:37.113111Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boucher-detecting-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) is an invasive insect infestation that is spreading into the forests of the northeastern United States, driven by the warmer winter temperatures associated with climate change. The initial stages of this disturbance are difficult to detect with passive optical remote sensing, since the insect often causes its host species, eastern hemlock trees (Tsuga canadensis), to defoliate in the midstory and understory before showing impacts in the overstory. New active remote sensing technologies\u0026mdash;such as the recently launched NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar\u0026mdash;can address this limitation by penetrating canopy gaps and recording lower canopy structural changes. This study explores new opportunities for monitoring the HWA infestation with airborne lidar scanning (ALS) and GEDI spaceborne lidar data. GEDI waveforms were simulated using airborne lidar datasets from an HWA-infested forest plot at the Harvard Forest ForestGEO site in central Massachusetts. Two airborne lidar instruments, the NASA G-LiHT and the NEON AOP, overflew the site in 2012 and 2016. GEDI waveforms were simulated from each airborne lidar dataset, and the change in waveform metrics from 2012 to 2016 was compared to field-derived hemlock mortality at the ForestGEO site. Hemlock plots were shown to be undergoing dynamic changes as a result of the HWA infestation, losing substantial plant area in the middle canopy, while still growing in the upper canopy. Changes in midstory plant area (PAI 11\u0026ndash;12 m above ground) and overall canopy permeability (indicated by RH10) accounted for 60% of the variation in hemlock mortality in a logistic regression model. The robustness of these structure-condition relationships held even when simulated waveforms were treated as real GEDI data with added noise and sparse spatial coverage. These results show promise for future disturbance monitoring studies with ALS and GEDI lidar data.","tags":["\"10\"","\"12\"","\"1304\"","\"2020\"","\"3390\"","\"com\"","\"disturbance\"","\"doi\"","\"g-liht\"","\"G-LiHT\"","\"gedi\"","\"GEDI\"","\"hemlock woolly adelgid\"","\"invasive\"","\"journal\"","\"lidar\"","\"mdpi\"","\"neon\"","\"NEON\"","\"remote sens\"","\"remotesensing\"","\"rs12081304\"","\"www\""],"title":"Detecting Change in Forest Structure with Simulated GEDI Lidar Waveforms: A Case Study of the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) Infestation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat-1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality. Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and follow-up with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop—justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.","tags":["\"ARD\"","\"Land change science\"","\"Land cover\"","\"Landsat science team\"","\"OLI\"","\"Open data\"","\"Remote sensing science\"","\"TIRS\""],"title":"Current status of Landsat program, science, and applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhan Li","Angela Erb","Qingsong Sun","Yan Liu","Yanmin Shuai","Zhuosen Wang","Peter Boucher","Crystal Schaaf"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139895,"objectID":"3aa6a15c360a4868d3c2d88cbf3f0282","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/li-2018-b/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:34.978044Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2018-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Satellite-based retrievals of land surface albedo at 20-m resolution are generated by coupling the surface reflectances from the recently launched Sentinel-2A satellite with surface anisotropy information (as described by Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function, BRDF) from either the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) or the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The intrinsic black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) values of the surface are derived at the six shortwave spectral bands of Sentinel-2A's Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI). A specific set of narrow-to-broadband conversion coefficients is derived from radiative transfer simulations and presented for the generation of broadband albedos. Initial evaluation uses well-calibrated ground-based albedo measurements by pyranometers mounted on the towers at seven sites of the Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD). Over those sites where pyranometer measurement footprints are not spatially representative of the landscape covered by the satellite pixels (i.e., spatially nonrepresentative) at the grid scales (500 m to 1 km) of the MODIS and VIIRS products, the finer-resolution Sentinel-2A albedos manifested a pronounced decrease in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean bias in the evaluation against the ground-based data as compared to the coarser resolution albedo products of MODIS and VIIRS. This decrease occurs because the 20-m Sentinel-2A albedo values are better able to resolve the spatial details of surface albedo within the ground-based instrument footprints than the coarser resolution sensors. This preliminary evaluation also demonstrates the consistency of the Sentinel-2A albedo results whether using the MODIS BRDF or the VIIRS BRDF products for the surface anisotropy information. The RMSEs and mean biases of the Sentinel-2A albedos over all the seven validation sites are both within the accuracy requirement of ±0.05 absolute albedo units for satellite derived albedo products. This study, to generate Sentinel-2A MSI albedo with either MODIS or VIIRS BRDFs, extends previous efforts of Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI albedo and enhances the continuity of finer-resolution albedo data. Such long-term and higher resolution records of surface albedo improve the investigations into the changes and drivers of local/regional surface energy balance over heterogeneous regions and increasingly fragmented landscapes across the globe due to natural and human-induced land cover changes.","tags":["\"Albedo\"","\"BRDF\"","\"MODIS\"","\"Sentinel-2\"","\"SURFRAD\"","\"Validation\"","\"VIIRS\""],"title":"Preliminary assessment of 20-m surface albedo retrievals from sentinel-2A surface reflectance and MODIS/VIIRS surface anisotropy measures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ian Paynter","Daniel Genest","Edward Saenz","Francesco Peri","Zhan Li","Alan Strahler","Crystal Schaaf"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139896,"objectID":"954747ae90fd4a0c555d48a16ba893c1","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/paynter-2018/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:36.091357Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paynter-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Considering the trajectories of pulses from terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) can provide refined models of occlusion and improve the assessment of observation quality in forests and other ecosystems. By considering the space traversed by light detection and ranging (lidar) pulses, we can separate empty regions of an ecosystem sample from unobserved regions of an ecosystem sample. We apply this method of TLS observation quality assessment, and analyze Compact Biomass Lidar 2 (CBL2) TLS observations of a single tree and of a deciduous forest stand. We show the contribution of information from each TLS scan to be inconsistent and the combination of multiple scans to have diminishing returns for new information, without guaranteeing complete coverage of a sample. We quantitatively investigate the effects of imposing information quality requirements on TLS sampling, for example, requiring minimum numbers of observations in each region or requiring regions to be observed from a minimum number of independent scans. We show empirically that rigid, predefined TLS sampling schemes, even with hypothetically dense coverage, cannot guarantee successful samples in geometrically complex systems such as forests. Through these methods, we lay the groundwork for on-the-fly assessment of observation quality according to several modeling-relevant metrics which enhance TLS ecosystem assessment. We also establish the value of flexible deployment options for TLS instruments, including the ability to deploy at a variety of heights.","tags":["\"Ecosystems\"","\"Forestry\"","\"Instruments\"","\"laser beams\"","\"laser measurements\"","\"Laser radar\"","\"Trajectory\"","\"Uncertainty\"","\"Vegetation\""],"title":"Quality Assessment of Terrestrial Laser Scanner Ecosystem Observations Using Pulse Trajectories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhan Li","Alan Strahler","Crystal Schaaf","David Jupp","Michael Schaefer","Pontus Olofsson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139893,"objectID":"0a723465efdef588cfd03dc6e33965b5","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/li-2018-a/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:33.301152Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"This study demonstrates the retrieval of separate vertical height profiles of leaf and woody areas in both leaf-off and leaf-on seasons at a largely broadleaf deciduous forest site in the Harvard Forest of central Massachusetts, USA, using point clouds acquired by a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), the Dual-Wavelength Echidna® Lidar (DWEL). Drawing on dual-wavelength information from the DWEL, we classified points as leafy or woody hits using their near-infrared (1064 nm) and shortwave infrared (1548 nm) apparent reflectance coupled with the 3-D spatial distribution patterns of points. We developed a new indirect assessment approach that quantified the accuracies (user’s, producer’s and overall) and variance of accuracies of the 3-D point classifications. The overall classification accuracy estimated by this indirect approach was 0.60 ± 0.01 – 0.77 ± 0.01 for leaf-off points and 0.71 ± 0.02 – 0.78 ± 0.01 for leaf-on points. These estimated accuracies were then utilized to adjust the proportions of separate gap probabilities to reduce the biases in the separate leaf and woody area profiles due to classification errors. Separate retrievals of leaf and woody area profiles revealed the change in their spatial heterogeneity over the 1-ha plot with season. These retrievals also allowed height-explicit estimation of the woody-to-total ratio, which is an empirical parameter often used to remove woody contributions to leaf area index retrievals made by optical methods. The estimates suggested the woody-to-total ratios generally stayed stable along height in the middle and upper canopy for this site but varied in the lower canopy. More accurate estimates of leaf area and its vertical profile are important for better measurement and modeling of the radiation regime of forest canopies, and thus their photosynthetic capacity. By separating leafy and woody materials in three dimensions, dual-wavelength TLS offers the prospect of better understanding of forest cycling of matter and energy within local and global ecosystems.","tags":["\"3-D classification\"","\"Accuracy assessment\"","\"Dual-wavelength\"","\"LAI\"","\"Lidar\"","\"Vertical profile\""],"title":"Seasonal change of leaf and woody area profiles in a midlatitude deciduous forest canopy from classified dual-wavelength terrestrial lidar point clouds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael A.

The major datasets used are: first, surface reflectance and vegetation indices (VI) by fusing the optical observations from the Landsat sensors and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; and second, the L-band radar data from the PALSAR-2 sensor onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2. We find that although the fused VI time series are not necessarily beneficial for paddy rice mapping, the fusion datasets reduce observational gaps and allow us to better identify peak VI values and derive their empirical relationships with crop-cutting yield data (R 2 = 0.4 for all the rice types, and R 2 = 0.69 for the dominant rice type -58% of all the sampled fields). The L-band radar data have slightly lower performance in rice mapping than the optical satellite data, while it has much less contribution to yield estimation than the optical data. Furthermore, our study suggests the geolocation errors of satellite images be taken into account when selecting small sample are as for crop cutting. This practice will ensure the representativeness of crop-cutting sample areas with regard to satellite observations and thus better linkages between field data and satellite pixels for yield modeling. We also highlight the need of crop-cutting data from multiple years and/or at different regions to account for the spatial and temporal variations of harvest index to improve the spatially explicit rice yield estimates through satellite observations.","tags":["\"Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2\"","\"Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2)\"","\"agriculture\"","\"Agriculture\"","\"ALOS-2/PALSAR-2\"","\"crop yield\"","\"crop-cutting data\"","\"crop-cutting sample areas\"","\"crop-cutting yield data\"","\"dominant rice type\"","\"Earth\"","\"field data\"","\"fused VI time series\"","\"fusion datasets\"","\"image fusion\"","\"L-band radar data\"","\"Landsat\"","\"Landsat sensors\"","\"map paddy rice areas\"","\"mapping paddy rice area\"","\"MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\"","\"moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MOD\"","\"MODIS\"","\"multiple satellite datasets\"","\"observational gaps\"","\"optical data\"","\"optical observations\"","\"optical satellite data\"","\"Optical sensors\"","\"paddy rice\"","\"paddy rice mapping\"","\"PALSAR-2 sensor\"","\"peak VI values\"","\"Production\"","\"Remote sensing\"","\"rice types\"","\"satellite images\"","\"satellite observations\"","\"satellite pixels\"","\"Satellites\"","\"spatially explicit rice yield\"","\"summer growing season\"","\"surface reflectance\"","\"Thai Binh Province\"","\"vegetation indices\"","\"Viet Nam\"","\"yield modeling\""],"title":"Mapping Paddy Rice Area and Yields Over Thai Binh Province in Viet Nam From MODIS, Landsat, and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhan Li","Michael Schaefer","Alan Strahler","Crystal Schaaf","David L.

From these scanning campaigns, we summarize the benefits and challenges given by DWEL's novel coaxial dual-wavelength scanning technology, particularly for the three-dimensional (3D) classification of vegetation elements. Simultaneous scanning at both 1064 nm and 1548 nm by DWEL instruments provides a new spectral dimension to TLS data that joins the 3D spatial dimension of lidar as an information source. Our point cloud classification algorithm explores the utilization of both spectral and spatial attributes of individual points from DWEL scans and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each attribute domain. The spectral and spatial attributes for vegetation element classification each perform better in different parts of vegetation (canopy interior, fine branches, coarse trunks, etc.) and under different vegetation conditions (dead or live, leaf-on or leaf-off, water content, etc.). These environmental characteristics of vegetation, convolved with the lidar instrument specifications and lidar data quality, result in the actual capabilities of spectral and spatial attributes to classify vegetation elements in 3D space. The spectral and spatial information domains thus complement each other in the classification process. The joint use of both not only enhances the classification accuracy but also reduces its variance across the multiple vegetation types we have examined, highlighting the value of the DWEL as a new source of 3D spectral information. Wider deployment of the DWEL instruments is in practice currently held back by challenges in instrument development and the demands of data processing required by coaxial dual- or multi-wavelength scanning. But the simultaneous 3D acquisition of both spectral and spatial features, offered by new multispectral scanning instruments such as the DWEL, opens doors to study biophysical and biochemical properties of forested and agricultural ecosystems at more detailed scales.","tags":["\"environmental science\""],"title":"On the utilization of novel spectral laser scanning for three-dimensional classification of vegetation elements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D A Orwig","P Boucher","I Paynter","E Saenz","Zhan Li","Crystal Schaaf"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139889,"objectID":"5a15c13a881e83aa3efe7a141f24b49d","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/orwig-2018/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:29.205439Z","relpermalink":"/publication/orwig-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Contemporary terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is being used widely in forest ecology applications to examine ecosystem properties at increasing spatial and temporal scales. Harvard Forest (HF) in Petersham, MA, USA, is a long-term ecological research (LTER) site, a National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) location and contains a 35 ha plot which is part of Smithsonian Institution\u0026#039;s Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO). The combination of long-term field plots, eddy flux towers and the detailed past historical records has made HF very appealing for a variety of remote sensing studies. Terrestrial laser scanners, including three pioneering research instruments: the Echidna Validation Instrument, the Dual-Wavelength Echidna Lidar and the Compact Biomass Lidar, have already been used both independently and in conjunction with airborne laser scanning data and forest census data to characterize forest dynamics. TLS approaches include three-dimensional reconstructions of a plot over time, establishing the impact of ice storm damage on forest canopy structure, and characterizing eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) canopy health affected by an invasive insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Efforts such as those deployed at HF are demonstrating the power of TLS as a tool for monitoring ecological dynamics, identifying emerging forest health issues, measuring forest biomass and capturing ecological data relevant to other disciplines. This paper highlights various aspects of the ForestGEO plot that are important to current TLS work, the potential for exchange between forest ecology and TLS, and emphasizes the strength of combining TLS data with long-term ecological field data to create emerging opportunities for scientific study.","tags":[],"title":"The potential to characterize ecological data with terrestrial laser scanning in Harvard Forest, MA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yaping Cai","Kaiyu Guan","Jian Peng","Shaowen Wang","Christopher Seifert","Brian Wardlow","Zhan Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139893,"objectID":"74450069e07d02034165975d05c53ef7","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/cai-2018/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:29.707518Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cai-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurate and timely spatial classification of crop types based on remote sensing data is important for both scientific and practical purposes. Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA's Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt.","tags":["\"Crop type classification\"","\"Deep Neural Network (DNN)\"","\"Machine learning\"","\"Phenology\"","\"Remote sensing\""],"title":"A high-performance and in-season classification system of field-level crop types using time-series Landsat data and a machine learning approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yan Liu","Zhuosen Wang","Qingsong Sun","Angela M Erb","Zhan Li","Crystal B Schaaf","Xiaoyang Zhang","Miguel O.

However, large data gaps caused by cloud or ephemeral snow have slowed the adoption of satellite albedo products by the climate modeling community. To address the needs of this community, we used a number of temporal and spatial gap-filling strategies to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of the global land surface MODIS BRDF, albedo and NBAR products. A rigorous evaluation of the gap-filled values shows good agreement with original high quality data (RMSE = 0.027 for the NIR band albedo, 0.020 for the red band albedo).

It has been conventionally viewed as a whole ice body with high albedo in General Circulation Models or Regional Climate Models and the differences of land cover has usually been overlooked. Land cover in Antarctica is one of the most important drivers of changes in the Earth system. Detailed land cover information over the Antarctic region is necessary as spatial resolution improves in land process models. However, there is a lack of complete Antarctic land cover dataset derived from a consistent data source. To fill this data gap, we have produced a database named Antarctic Land Cover Database for the Year 2000 (AntarcticaLC2000) using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data acquired around 2000 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images acquired in the austral summer of 2003/2004 according to the criteria for the 1:100000-scale. Three land cover types were included in this map, separately, ice-free rocks, blue ice, and snow/firn. This classification legend was determined based on a review of the land cover systems in Antarctica (LCCSA) and an analysis of different land surface types and the potential of satellite data. Image classification was conducted through a combined usage of computer-aided and manual interpretation methods. A total of 4067 validation sample units were collected through visual interpretation in a stratified random sampling manner. An overall accuracy of 92.3% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.836 were achieved. Results show that the areas and percentages of ice-free rocks, blue ice, and snow/firn are 73268.81 km2 (0.537%), 225937.26 km2 (1.656%), and 13345460.41 km2 (97.807%), respectively.

We performed studies with the CBL in temperate and tropical forests, caves, salt marshes and coastal areas subject to erosion. By facilitating additional scanning points, and therefore view angles, this new class of terrestrial lidar alters observation coverage within samples, potentially reducing uncertainty in estimates of ecosystem properties. The CBL has proved competent at reconstructing trees and mangrove roots using the same cylinder-based Quantitative Structure Models commonly utilized for data from more capable instruments (Raumonen et al. 2013). For tropical trees with morphologies that challenge standard reconstruction techniques, such as the buttressed roots of Ceiba trees and the multiple stems of strangler figs, the CBL was able to provide the versatility and the speed of deployment needed to fully characterize their unique features. For geomorphological features, the deployment flexibility of the CBL enabled sampling from optimal view-angles, including from a novel suspension system for sampling salt marsh creeks. Overall, the practical aspects of these instruments, which improve deployment logistics, and therefore data acquisition rate, are shown to be emerging capabilities, greatly increasing the potential for observation, particularly in highly temporally dynamic, inaccessible and geometrically complex ecosystems. In order to better analyze information quality across these diverse and challenging ecosystems, we also provide a novel and much-needed conceptual framework, the microstate model, to characterize and mitigate uncertainties in terrestrial lidar observations.","tags":["\"cbl\"","\"compact biomass lidar\"","\"ecosystem\"","\"lidar\"","\"models\"","\"properties\"","\"quantitative structure\"","\"terrestrial lidar scanners\"","\"validation\""],"title":"Observing ecosystems with lightweight, rapid-scanning terrestrial lidar scanners","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The reflectance, calculated from the energy of lidar returns, is a key parameter for a wide range of applications and so it is vital to extract it accurately. Fifteen separate methods have been proposed to extract return energy (the amount of light backscattered from a target), ranging from simple to mathematically complex, but the relative accuracies have not yet been assessed. This paper uses a simulator to compare all methods over a wide range of targets and lidar system parameters. For hard targets the simplest methods (windowed sum, peak and quadratic) gave the most consistent estimates. They did not have high accuracies, but low standard deviations show that they could be calibrated to give accurate energy. This may be why some commercial lidar developers use them, where the primary interest is in surveying solid objects. However, simulations showed that these methods are not appropriate over vegetation. The widely used Gaussian fitting performed well over hard targets (0.24% root mean square error, RMSE), as did the sum and spline methods (0.30% RMSE). Over vegetation, for large footprint (15 m) systems, Gaussian fitting performed the best (12.2% RMSE) followed closely by the sum and spline (both 12.7% RMSE). For smaller footprints (33 cm and 1 cm) over vegetation, the relative accuracies were reversed (0.56% RMSE for the sum and spline and 1.37% for Gaussian fitting). Gaussian fitting required heavy smoothing (convolution with an 8 m Gaussian) whereas none was needed for the sum and spline. These simpler methods were also more robust to noise and far less computationally expensive than Gaussian fitting. Therefore it was concluded that the sum and spline were the most accurate for extracting return energy from waveform lidar over vegetation, except for large footprint (15 m), where Gaussian fitting was slightly more accurate. These results suggest that small footprint (≪ 15 m) lidar systems that use Gaussian fitting or proprietary algorithms may report inaccurate energies, and thus reflectances, over vegetation. In addition the effect of system pulse length, sampling interval and noise on accuracy for different targets was assessed, which has implications for sensor design.","tags":["\"Forests\"","\"Full waveform\"","\"Lidar\"","\"Reflectance\"","\"Signal processing\""],"title":"Waveform lidar over vegetation: An evaluation of inversion methods for estimating return energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ewan S.

Fifteen waveform metrics were derived from GLAS data while band ratios and surface spectral reflectance were taken from Landsat TM/ETM+. Random forest (RF) was used in feature selection and classification of footprints along with support vector machines (SVMs). The categories of classification included croplands, forests, shrublands, water bodies, and impervious surfaces. Compared with the use of waveform or spectral features alone in land cover classification, the joint use of waveform and spectral data as inputs improved the classification accuracy of footprints. An overall accuracy (OA) of 91% was achieved by either RF or SVM when features from both GLAS and Landsat sources were used increasing upon an accuracy of 85% if only one source was used. The high accuracy land cover data obtained by the joint use of the two data sources could be used as additional references in large scale land cover mapping when ground truth is hard to obtain. It is believed that the increase in accuracy is largely a result from the inclusion of the additional information of vertical structure offered by waveform lidar.","tags":["\"Accuracy\"","\"altimeters\"","\"and land elevation satellite\"","\"China\"","\"Classification\"","\"cloud\"","\"cropland category\"","\"Earth\"","\"Enhanced TM Plus\"","\"ETM+-derived band ratios\"","\"ETM+-derived surface spectral reflectance\"","\"feature selection\"","\"footprint classification accuracy\"","\"forest category\"","\"forestry\"","\"geophysical image processing\"","\"geoscience laser altimeter system\"","\"GLAS data-derived waveform metrics\"","\"GLAS footprints\"","\"Henan Province\"","\"high accuracy land cover data\"","\"ice\"","\"ICESat-GLAS\"","\"image classification\"","\"impervious surface category\"","\"joint waveform-spectral data source use\"","\"land cover\"","\"land cover category discrimination\"","\"land cover classification\"","\"landsat data\"","\"Landsat thematic mapper spectral features\"","\"Landsat TM-derived band ratios\"","\"Landsat TM-derived surface spectral reflectance\"","\"large scale land cover mapping\"","\"Laser radar\"","\"lidar\"","\"Lidar waveform features\"","\"Radio frequency\"","\"random forest\"","\"random forest (RF)\"","\"Remote sensing\"","\"RF\"","\"Satellites\"","\"shrubland category\"","\"spectral data input\"","\"support vector machines\"","\"Support vector machines\"","\"support vector machines (SVMs)\"","\"SVM\"","\"terrain mapping\"","\"vegetation mapping\"","\"water body category\"","\"waveform data input\"","\"waveform lidar vertical structure\"","\"waveform metrics\""],"title":"Joint Use of ICESat/GLAS and Landsat Data in Land Cover Classification: A Case Study in Henan Province, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["FengMing M Hui","Xiao Cheng","Yan Liu","YanMei M Zhang","YuFang F Ye","XianWei W Wang","Zhan Li","Kun Wang","ZhiFei F Zhan","JianHong H Guo","Huabing Huang","XiuHong H Li","Z.

These maps were mainly developed by manual interpretation and validated by substantial field investigation in 2009. Based on these maps, we analyzed the 2008 wetland distribution in China and discussed wetland changes and their drivers over the past 30 years. (i) There were about 324097 km 2 of wetlands in 2008, for which inland marshes or swamps were the most common wetland type (35%), with lakes (26%) second. Most of the wetlands were in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Tibet, occupying about 55% of the national wetland area. (ii) From 1978 to 2008, China's wetland area continually and significantly decreased, by about 33% based on changes in the wetland map. This was in sharp contrast to the increase in artificial wetlands, which increased by about 122%. Inland marshes accounted for the main loss of total wetlands from 1978 to 2000. From 2000 through 2008, riverine and lacustrine wetlands constituted the main wetland loss. Fortunately however, the rate of wetland loss decreased from 5523 to 831 km 2/a. (iii) The change ratio of lost natural wetlands (including inland and coastal wetlands) to non-wetlands has decreased slightly over the past 30 years. From 1978 to 1990, nearly all natural wetlands (98%) lost were transformed into non-wetlands. However, the ratio declined to 86% from 1990 to 2000, and to 77% from 2000 to 2008. (iv) All Chinese provinces were divided into three groups according to patterns of wetland changes, which could relate to the driving forces of such changes. Tibet was completely different from other provinces, as it was one representative example in which there was a net wetland increase, because of global warming and decreased human activity since 1990. Increased economic development caused considerable wetland loss in most eastern provinces, and artificial wetlands increased.","tags":[],"title":"Mapping wetland changes in China between 1978 and 2008","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xianwei Wang","Xiao Cheng","Peng Gong","Huabing Huang","Zhan Li","Xiaowen Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1312156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139870,"objectID":"5f0a4d9576291b7567bb1ed3c2c68ee6","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/wang-2011/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:09.799858Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) completed 19 successful campaigns for Earth observation missions following its launch in 2003.

Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is particularly suitable to the measurement of forest structural parameters. In this paper, we describe a pilot study to extract forest structural parameters, such as tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and position of individual tree using a terrestrial lidar (LMS-Z360i; Riegel, Inc.). The lidar was operated to acquire both vertical and horizontal scanning in the field in order to obtain a point cloud of the whole scene. An Iterative Closet Point (ICP) algorithm was introduced to obtain the transformation matrix of each range image and to mosaic multiple range images together. Based on the mosaiced data set, a variable scale and threshold filtering method was used to separate ground from the vegetation. Meanwhile, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a Canopy Height Model (CHM) were generated from the classified point cloud. A stem detection algorithm was used to extract the location of individual trees. A slice above 1.3 m from the ground was extracted and rasterized. A circle fitting algorithm combined with the Hough transform was used to retrieve the DBH based on the rasterized grid. Tree heights were calculated using the height difference between the minimum and maximum Z values within the position of each individual tree with a 1 m buffer. All of the 26 trees were detected correctly, tree height and DBH were determined with a precision of 0.76 m and 3.4 cm, respectively, comparing with those visually measured in the lidar data. Our methods and results confirm that terrestrial lidar can provide nondestructive, high-resolution, and automatic determination of parameters required in forest inventory.","tags":[],"title":"Automated Methods for Measuring DBH and Tree Heights with a Commercial Scanning Lidar","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Gong","Zhan Li","Huabing Huang","Guoqing Sun","Lei Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1298937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139871,"objectID":"53e70846aedac6be1e53840d0c27e025","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/gong-2011/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:10.889374Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gong-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Although the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the NASA Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite was not designed for urban applications, its 3-D measurement capability over the globe makes it a nice feature for consideration in monitoring urban heights. However, this has not been previously done. In this paper, we report some preliminary assessment of the GLAS data for building height and density estimation in a suburb of Beijing, China. Building heights can be directly calculated from a GLAS data product (GLA14). Because GLA14 limits height levels to six in each ground footprint, we developed a new method to remove this restriction by processing the raw GLAS data. The maximum heights measured in the field at selected GLAS footprints were used to validate the GLAS measurement results. By assuming a constant incident energy and surface reflectance within a GLAS footprint, the building density can be estimated from GLA14 or from our newly processed GLAS data. The building density determined from high-resolution images in Google Earth was used to validate the GLAS estimation results. The results indicate that the newly developed method can produce more accurate building height estimation within each GLAS footprint (R2 = 0.937, rmse = 6.4 m, and n = 26) than the GLA14 data product (R2 = 0.808, rmse = 11.5 m, and n = 26). However, satisfactory estimation results on building density cannot be obtained from the GLAS data with the methods investigated in this paper. Forest cover could be a challenge to building height and density estimation from the GLAS data. It should be addressed in future research.","tags":["\"3D measurement capability\"","\"altimeters\"","\"Beijing\"","\"Building density\"","\"building density estimation\"","\"building height\"","\"building height estimation\"","\"China\"","\"Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite\"","\"environmental monitoring (geophysics)\"","\"forest cover\"","\"Geoscience Laser Altimeter System\"","\"global change\"","\"Google Earth\"","\"height measurement\"","\"ICESat GLAS data\"","\"laser altimetry\"","\"NASA Ice\"","\"remote sensing\"","\"urban environment monitoring\"","\"urban growth\"","\"urban heigh smonitoring\""],"title":"ICESat GLAS Data for Urban Environment Monitoring","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Gong","ZhenGuo Niu","Xiao Cheng","KuiYi Zhao","DeMin Zhou","JianHong Guo","Lu Liang","XianWei XiaoFeng Wang","DanDan Li","HuaBing Huang","Yi Wang","Kun Wang","WenNing Li","XianWei XiaoFeng Wang","Qing Ying","ZhenZhong Yang","YuFang Ye","Zhan Li","DaFang Zhuang","YaoBin Chi","HuiZhen Zhou","Jun Yan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1277942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617139897,"objectID":"a8711cffdd1eb2bd6be012b1548574ab","permalink":"https://zhanlilz.github.io/publication/gong-2010/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T21:31:36.614978Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gong-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Two wetland maps for the entire China have been produced based on Landsat data acquired around 1990 and 2000.
